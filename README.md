# Algorithms

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a particular order, typically in ascending or descending order. Sorting can be applied to various types of data, such as numbers, strings, or complex data structures. The goal of sorting is to organize the data so that it becomes easier to search, analyze, or manipulate.

Sorting Algorithms:
1) Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2) Selection Sort: Finds the smallest element in the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
3) Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted list one element at a time by comparing and inserting elements into their correct positions.
4) Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together.
5) Quick Sort: Selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot, then recursively sorts the partitions.
